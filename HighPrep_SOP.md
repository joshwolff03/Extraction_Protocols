# HighPrep Magnetic DNA Extraction

### BEFORE YOU BEGIN
  1. Gather Materials 
      * DNA elution plate (1 per 96 rxns)
      * Micropipettes (1000, 100, 10 uL)
      * Pipette tips (1000, 100, 10 uL)
      * HSW wash buffer
      * 100% ethanol (430 uL/sample)
      * 70% ethanol (800 uL/sample)
      * AS buffer
      * Pro K solution
      * Bead tubes
      * MAG-S1 particles (10 uL/sample)
      * Magnetic plate
      * Deep well plate (1 per 96 rxns)
      * MB elution buffer (100 uL/sample)
    
### DNA EXTRACTION
  1. Add 1000 uL of sample to bead tube
  2.	Add 300 uL AS buffer to sample and vortex to mix
  3.	Load bead tubes into bead ruptor and run for 10 minutes at 20 Hz
  4.	Add 20 uL Pro K solution to sample and mix via pipette or vortex
  5.	Incubate at 65° C for 10 minutes
  6.	Pipette supernatant into deep well plate
  7.	Add 430 uL 100% ethanol and 10 uL MAG-S1 particles to sample and pipette to mix
  8.	Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes
  9.	Place deep well plate on magnetic separation plate until the beads fully separate from the solution
  10.	Remove and discard supernatant without disturbing the separated beads (while the plate is still on the magnetic separation device)
  11.	Remove plate from magnetic separation device and add 400 uL HSW Buffer to samples and pipette to mix
  12.	Incubate at room temperature for 1 minute
  13.	Place sample on magnetic separation device until the beads fully separate from solution
  14.	Remove and discard supernatant while plate is still on the magnetic separation device
  15. Remove plate from magnetic separation device and add 400 uL 70% ethanol to sample.  Pipette to mix
  16.	Incubate at room temperature for 1 minute
  17.	Place sample plate on magnetic separation device until the beads fully separate from solution
  18.	Remove and discard supernatant while plate is still on the magnetic separation device
  19.	Repeat steps 10-13 for a second ethanol wash
  20.	Dry the beads by incubating at room temperature for 3 minutes with the plate still on the magnetic separation device
  21.	Add 100 uL MB elution buffer to sample and vortex to completely resuspend MAG-S1 particles
  22.	Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes
  23.	Place sample plate back on the magnetic separation device until the beads fully separate from solution
  24.	Remove supernatant and place in DNA elution plate – this is now the final extracted DNA.  Store at -20° C.
