## Purpose
The purpose of this SOP is to provide procedures for purifying genomic DNA from milk samples collected from livestock (cattle, goats, sheep) intended for Real-Time PCR detection of Brucella species.  
## Scope
This SOP is applicable to all BruSTAR project personnel in Tanzania and Rwanda involved in DNA extraction.   
## Document Control 
This SOP is reviewed annually or in the interim if changes are necessary. The official copy is the electronic document stored in the project Onedrive folder at PSU. Controlled printed copies are distributed to each of the locations recorded on the Document Tracking Spreadsheet. 
## Safety
At a minimum, these procedures should be performed using BSL-2 facilities and BSL-3 practices. Perform all sample manipulations within a Class II (or higher) biological safety cabinet (BSC). Refer to Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL), 6th edition. http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/index.htm 
## Training 
* Laboratory personnel responsible for extracting nucleic acid should have a background in molecular biology, biotechnology, biochemistry, molecular genetics. Hands-on training, including the review of standard operating procedures or manuals, should be completed for each technique under the supervision of experienced personnel. A new employee will receive orientation and skills training. New or established employees shall receive training on new methods given by the method developer. The laboratory should maintain a training record for each Laboratory personnel that documents the following: 
    * Dates and scope of Nucleic acid extraction training 
    * Initial demonstration of capability 
    * Proficiency test results for each analysis type 
    * Dates and scope of laboratory QA/QC training  
    * Dates and scope of laboratory safety training 
## Quality Control 
* Quarterly or every six months, the National Public Health Laboratory will distribute the proficiency panel to the Brucella collaborating Institutes. 
* Each sample is evaluated to ensure that DNA extraction has successfully used the Qubit Fluorometer.  
* If the concentration of DNA recovered from a sample is too low to be quantitated utilizing this method, the extraction is repeated.

### Preparation of lysis buffer: 
#### Materials
* 20mM Tris-HCl 
* 2mM EDTA 
* 1.2% Triton 
#### Preparation
* Take 20 ml of 20mM Tris-HCl, 12 ml Triton X, 2ml EDTA. Add water to make 1 L of the buffer solution—store at room temperature. Label the bottle. 
* On the day of extraction, take 1 ml of this buffer solution in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and add 80 mg of lysozyme to make the lysis buffer. You will need 180ul of this for every sample. 
* This work should be performed inside a biological hood level 2 (BSL2) following BSL3 precautions.  
### Preparation of QIAGEN reagents  
* Buffer AL (stored at room temperature, 15–25°C) Mix Buffer AL thoroughly by shaking before use. Buffer AL is stable for 1 year when stored at room temperature.  **Note: Do not add QIAGEN Protease or proteinase K directly to Buffer AL.**
* Proteinase K is commonly used in molecular biology to digest protein and remove contamination from nucleic acid preparations. The addition of proteinase K to nucleic acid preparations rapidly inactivates nucleases that might otherwise degrade the DNA or RNA during purification. 
* When using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (50), pipet 1.2 ml protease solvent* into the vial containing lyophilized QIAGEN Protease, as indicated on the label. When using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (250), pipet 5.5 ml protease solvent into the vial containing lyophilized QIAGEN Protease, as indicated on the label. Dissolved QIAGEN Protease is stable for up to 12 months when stored at 2–8°C. 
* Buffer AW1 (stored at room temperature, 15–25°C) Buffer AW1 is supplied as a concentrate. Before using for the first time, add the appropriate amount of ethanol (96–100%) as indicated on the bottle. Buffer AW1 is stable for 1 year when stored closed at room temperature.  
* Buffer AW2 (stored at room temperature, 15–25°C) Buffer AW2 is supplied as a concentrate. Before using for the first time, add the appropriate amount of ethanol (96–100%) to Buffer AW2 concentrate as indicated on the bottle. Buffer AW2 is stable for 1 year when stored closed at room temperature. 
### Handling of QIAamp Mini columns 
* Owing to the sensitivity of nucleic acid amplification technologies, the following precautions are necessary when handling QIAamp Mini columns to avoid cross-contamination between sample preparations:  
    * Carefully apply the sample or solution to the QIAamp Mini column. Pipet the sample into the QIAamp Mini column without wetting the rim of the column.  
    * Change pipet tips between all liquid transfers. The use of aerosol-barrier pipet tips is recommended. 
    * Avoid touching the QIAamp membrane with the pipet tip. 
    * After all pulse-vortexing steps, briefly centrifuge the 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes to remove drops from the inside of the lid. 
     * Wear gloves throughout the entire procedure. In case of contact between gloves and sample, change gloves immediately. 
### Important points before starting 
* All centrifugation steps are carried out at room temperature (15–25ºC). 
* Avoid repeated freezing and thawing of stored samples since this reduces DNA size. 
* Things to do before starting: 
* Equilibrate the sample to room temperature (15–25ºC). 
* Heat 3 water baths or heating blocks: Set at 56ºC and 96ºC. 
* Equilibrate Buffer AE or distilled water to room temperature for elution. 
* Ensure that Buffers AW1 and AW2 have been prepared according to the instructions on page 16 of the complete handout/ and as written on the bottle. 
* If a precipitate has formed in Buffer ATL or Buffer AL, dissolve by incubating at 56ºC. 
### Centrifugation of milk sample to get the pelleted bacteria 
* This work should be performed inside a biological hood level 2 (BSL2) following BSL3 precautions 
* Centrifuge 1.5 ml of the milk in a 1.7- or 2.0-ml Eppendorf tubes at 3500 RPM (800-1000 rcf) in a tabletop centrifuge @ 4°C for 10 minutes. 
* Resuspend the pellet in 2 ml PBS 
* Centrifuge at 800 to 1000 RPM (100 x g) @ 4°C for 10 minutes 
* Collect the supernatant 
* Centrifuge the supernatant @3000 rpm to get bacteria pellet for 5 minutes 
### DNA extraction from  bacteria pellet using  Qiagen kit #: 51104, QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (50)- Cat No./ID: 51104 
* Isolation of bacterial DNA from biological fluids  
* Start with the pelleted bacteria from milk 
* Suspend bacterial pellet in 180 μl of the lysis buffer [appropriate enzyme solution (20 mg/ml lysozyme or 200 μg/ml lysostaphin; 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0; 2 mM EDTA; 1.2% Triton)]. 
* Incubate for at least 30 min at 37°C. 
* Add 20 μl proteinase K and 200 μl Buffer AL. Mix by vortexing. 
* Incubate at 56°C for 30 min and then for a further 15 min at 95°C. 
     * Note: Extended incubation at 95°C can lead to some DNA degradation. 
* Centrifuge for a few seconds. 
* Add 200 μl ethanol (96–100%) to the sample, and mix by pulse-vortexing for 15 s. After mixing, briefly centrifuge the 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube to remove drops inside the lid. The ethanol wash removes low molecular weight contaminants like salts and detergents. 
     * Note: It is essential that the sample, Buffer AL, and the ethanol are mixed thoroughly to yield a homogeneous solution. A white precipitate may form on the addition of ethanol. It is essential to apply all the precipitate to the QIAamp Mini spin column. This precipitate does not interfere with the QIAamp procedure or with any subsequent application.  
* Do not use alcohols other than ethanol since this may result in reduced yields. 
* Carefully apply the mixture (including the precipitate) to the QIAamp Mini spin column (in a 2 ml collection tube) without wetting the rim. Close the cap, and centrifuge at 6000 x g (8000 rpm) for 1 min. Place the QIAamp Mini spin column in a clean 2 ml collection tube (provided) and discard the tube containing the filtrate. 
* Flow-through contains Buffer AL or Buffer AW1 and is therefore not compatible with bleach.  
     * Note: Close each spin column to avoid aerosol formation during centrifugation.  
* It is essential to apply all the precipitate to the QIAamp Mini spin column.  
* Centrifugation is performed at 6000 x g (8000 rpm) to reduce noise. Centrifugation at full speed will not affect the yield or purity of the DNA. If the solution has not completely passed through the membrane, centrifuge again at a higher speed until all the solution has passed through. 
* Carefully open the QIAamp Mini spin column and add 500 μl Buffer AW1 without wetting the rim. Close the cap, and centrifuge at 6000 x g (8000 rpm) for 1 min. 
* Place the QIAamp Mini spin column in a clean 2 ml collection tube (provided) and discard the collection tube containing the filtrate. 
* Carefully open the QIAamp Mini spin column and add 500 μl Buffer AW2 without wetting the rim. Close the cap and centrifuge at full speed (20,000 x g; 14,000 rpm) for 3 min. 
     * Recommended: Place the QIAamp Mini spin column in a new 2 ml collection tube (not provided) and discard the old collection tube with the filtrate. Centrifuge at full speed for 1 min. 
* Place the QIAamp Mini spin column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube (not provided) and discard the collection tube containing the filtrate. 
* Carefully open the QIAamp Mini spin column and add 200 μl Buffer AE or Nuclease-free distilled water (preferred). 
* Incubate at room temperature for 1 min, and then centrifuge at 6000 x g (8000 rpm) for 1 min. 
* Measure the DNA concentration using a Nanodrop/Qubit. 
* Please mark the tubes of DNA with the following information: DNA from milk, Date, your initials, concentration in ng/ul. 
* Store at -20ºC on a clearly marked sample box. 
### Determination of concentration, yield, and purity 
* DNA yields are determined from the concentration of DNA in the eluate, measured by absorbance at 260 nm. 
* Purity is determined by calculating the absorbance ratio at 260 nm to absorbance at 280 nm. 
* Pure DNA has an A260/A280 ratio of 1.7–1.9.
