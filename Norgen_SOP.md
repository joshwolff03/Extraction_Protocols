# Norgen DNA Extraction Procedure
### Gather Materials
* P10, P100, P1000 Pipettes and tips
* Bead tubes
* Provided kit reagents:
    * Lysis Buffer L
    * Lysis Additive A
    * Binding Buffer I
    * Magnetic bead suspension
    * Solution WN
    * Elution Buffer B
* 70% ethanol

### Lyse Samples
1.  Add 500 µL sample and 800 µL Lysis Buffer L to bead tube
2.  Add 100 µL Lysis Additive A to bead tube and vortex briefly
3.  Load samples into bead ruptor for 3 minutes at 20 Hz
4.  Centrifuge lysate at 20,800 x g (14,000 RPM) for 2 minutes
5.  Transfer 600 µL of supernatant to a DNase-free microcentrifuge tube
6.  Add 100 µL Binding Buffer I, mix by inversion, and incubate on ice for 10 minutes
7.  Centrifuge samples at 20,800 x g (14,000 RPM) for 2 minutes to pellet any cell debris
8.  Transfer 600 µL of supernatant into a new DNase-free microcentrifuge tube
9.  Add 300 µL of 100% molecular-grade ethanol and 20 µL magnetic bead suspension to the collected lysate
10.  Shake and incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes
### DNA Isolation
1. Place lysate onto magnetic plate and incubate at room temperature until beads precipitate from solution
2. Aspirate and discard supernatant without touching the beads
3. Remove tubes from the magnetic plate and add 500 µL Solution WN and vortex to mix
4. Place tubes on the magnetic plate and incubate at room temperature until beads precipitate from solution
5. Aspirate and discard supernatant without touching the beads
6. Remove tubes from the magnetic plate and add 500 µL of 70% molecular-grade ethanol to samples, vortex to mix
7. Place tubes back onto magnetic plate and incubate at room temperature until beads precipitate from solution
8. Aspirate and discard supernatant
9. Repeat steps 6-8 for a second 70% ethanol wash
10. Incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature with tubes open to dry the beads
11. Add 100 µL Elution Buffer B
12. Incubate for 10 minutes at 65° C
13. Place tubes on magnetic plate and transfer the supernatant to a new DNase-free microcentrifuge tube
14. Collected DNA can be stored at 4° C for a few days or -20° C for long-term storage
