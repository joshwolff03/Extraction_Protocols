### Ganda Laboratory
# MagMax Manual DNA Extraction Protocol
### BEFORE YOU BEGIN										
* Prepare your workspace
* Turn on Biological Safety Cabinet blower, white light, and window alarm.
* Clean the cabinet with 70% ethanol, including the work surface, walls, and glass.
* Lower the sash and run the UV light for 15 minutes.
* Do not trust the glass to protect you from UV exposure. You can be in a different part of the lab while it is running, but do not loiter in front of the cabinet.
* Switch the UV light back to white light; you are ready to begin.
* Clean all materials with 70% ethanol before putting them into the cabinet.
### Gather materials 
* You can use the small projector cart to hold materials and your notes next to the cabinet. Clean cart well with 70% ethanol before use.
* MagMAX™ MICROBIOME Ultra Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit 
* 200PF Molecular Grade Ethanol
* Nuclease-Free Water
* Sterile Pipette Tips (P100, P1000)
* Serological Pipettor
* Serological Pipettes (25, 50)
* 50 mL conical tube(s)
*	Plate Tube rack
*	Reagent Reservoirs 
*	Bead tubes
*	2.0mL microcentrifuge tubes
*	Zymo 1:10 (for positive control)
*	Tube rack magnet
*	Plate Map (reference “2.3_Plate-Map-Template”)
### LYSE SAMPLE											
* Add 800 uL of Lysis Buffer to bead tubes.
* Prepare non-fecal samples as follows: 

Bacteria/Yeast culture	| Remove 500uL of the prepared culture, and then place in the prepared bead tube.
Soil Samples | Weigh out 200-250mg and place in tube.
Biofluid or Liquid Sample | Remove 400-500uL and place in tube.
Skin/Buccal Swab | Remove plastic stick and place in tube.

* Vortex the bead tubes upside down for 10 seconds. 
* Place tubes in bead ruptor for 10 minutes at 20 Hz. Remove and centrifuge for 2 minutes at 14,000xg
* At this point bead tubes can be stored at 4°C overnight.

### PREPARE REAGENTS										

*	Prepare mixture of Viral/Pathogen Binding Solution + DNA/RNA Binding Beads

| Reagent | For 50 reactions |
| --- | --- |
| Viral/Pathogen Binding Solution	| 25 mL |
| DNA/RNA Binding Beads (vortex vigorously first)	| 1 mL (or 1000 ul)|
* Combine 500 ul/sample of Viral/Pathogen Binding Solution and 20 ul/sample of DNA/RNA Binding Beads. Note: these solutions are very viscous! 
    * Prepare enough for 100 rxns if running a full plate:
         * Mix solution well by inversion and store at room temperature. Do not vortex, or it will be too foamy to aliquot.  
*	Prepare 80% Ethanol Wash Buffer
  *	Make enough 80% Ethanol for 2 mL per sample.

|In a clean flask | (100 rxns total) |
| --- | --- |
| 100% molecular-grade ethanol | 160 mL |
| Invitrogen Ultra-Pure Water	| 40 mL |
